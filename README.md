This is expected to act as the core-library of the new Music Blocks 2 application. Music Blocks has
a lot of musical state management which can be done independent of the GUI application. The
application will handle all the audio-visual and interactive features while this will handle all the
internal intricasies the application shall eventually depend on this for its behavior.
